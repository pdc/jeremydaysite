Title: Jeremy Day Projects
Keyword-separator: ,

I have been drawing and writing since I could hold a crayon, and taking photos almost as long. Some of these projects ended up digitzed and online. My first website was a Geocities site. These projects have been rescued and now live in the 1999 section of this colection.
