    <td><b>Take a promenade along West Pier</b> Since the partial collapse of part of one pier in Brighton,
    and the partial destruction by fire of another, I've been feeling the importance of preserving what
    yet remains of pier and promenade on Brighton Beach, one of the very best beaches in England. It's
    pebbly, slopes steeply into the unfriendly grey waters of the channel, and it's crowded with chip
    shops, tat shops and sullen artists. On top of that, it's usually wet
    and windy. But under the  veneer of plastic you can still see the bones of its former grandeur,
    a cast-iron Victorian dream of endless holiday; the seaside the sun will never set on. At West Pier,
    abandoned and sealed off for years, the bones lie closest to the surface. Come on in and see the final
    decay of the Victorian seaside fantasy, with extra added pigeon shit!

    Pier was separated from the mainland bit by bit. The part connecting it to the promenade (I'm standing there
    taking the photo) was the last to go. The posts jutting out of the pebbles used to hold up the deck of
    the Pier.

    (and ended) with an instructive talk in the locked-off space under the stump of the pier. It was was
    full of rescued pieces of the pier, in varying states of decay. These are some
    of the ancient support poles, encrusted with rust and barnacles.
