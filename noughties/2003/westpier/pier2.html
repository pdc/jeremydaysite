    <br>Correction, a slender metal, completely see-through walkway. My companion suffers from fear of heights,
    or possibly narrow walkways, I forget. Either way, he's telling me the same damn story about heights/narrow walkways
    (the dangers thereof) <i>again</i>.

    <td><img src="pier04.jpg" alt="Along the walkway to the Ballroom" align="left"><b>Looking along the walkway</b> <br>None
    of this first half of the Pier is safe; the metal walkway continues into the Ballroom, ahead. That partial
    collapse of the side there was nothing to worry about, they said; the renovation was at that time concentrating on
    the hidden depths of the pier, its connection to the sea-bed.

    anchored to the sea bed with extremely long screws. These are not the screws; they're actually decorative ironwork
    pillars demonstrating the dilapidation of the ironwork and renovation techniques.

    <br>Just outside the ballroom, we stop for a brief lecture before heading inside. The pier is wired for lights
    (a huge neon sign proclaims "WEST PIE" every evening) but I don't know why those Christmas trees are there.<br><br>Oh look, isn't that <br><b><a href="pier3.html">a nice ceiling</a></b>.
