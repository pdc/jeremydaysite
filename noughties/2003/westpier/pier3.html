    <br>We turn back to the tall, pale hotel blocks of the modern sea-front while the tour guide points out the delicate
    ironwork that fringes the porch outside the ballroom. The iron pillars (as always) look far too thin to be strong enough for the job.

    <td><img src="pier07.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Ballroom" align="left"><b>This is not a safe structure</b> <br>
    It doesn't look safe, and it certainly doesn't smell safe, it smells like a bird-house, of shit and rotting feathers. What
    looks like it might be plaster decoration isn't of course, it is (like almost everything else) painted ironwork. Plaster
    would just dissolve in the salt air.

    closely and you can see them; pigeons, sat along the shattered window farmes, cooing in the roof, flapping in and out of
    the gaps in the ceiling. Even if we were allowed off the walkway, we wouldn't go; the floor is encrusted with shit, feathers, and
    maggoty pigeon corpses.

    <br>This huge structure was originally a ballroom, then a dance-hall. At last it modernised, and got an arcade, but the
    West Pier never was a good moderniser, and just got shabbier and tattier and dirtier until it was closed.<br><br>Yes, but <b><a href="pier4.html">what colour is it?</a></b>.
