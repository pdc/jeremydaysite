    <br>All the other shots are taken with an Ilford B/W disposable I had on me, but the colours were so lovely I decided
    to risk a real camera for this one shot. The faded greens and creams were probably lurid when they were first painted,
    but they're now lovely; subtle; streaked with rust.

    The Pier was mined and partially destroyed during World War II as part of Britain's sea defences. The far
    end of the Pier was entirely separated from the rest, and the deck between these points is extra-specially unsafe; it looks like it's trying to separate off again.

    Pier. We can't get down there, that's more space that belongs to the birds. Pigeons now, but every evening, starlings swirl around West Pier like gritty smoke
    for hours, sometimes, before coming to roost.

    <br>Just outside the old Theatre, an old kiosk used to sell refreshments, and then (when it, too, became an arcade) tokens
    and fizzy drinks. It's stranded now, marooned in a sea of rotting wood; still has a sign up, though.<br>
