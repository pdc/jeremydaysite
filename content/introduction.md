I live in
in Oxford in England, where I am a web editor by day and a comics creator by nightâ€”making
minicomics,
altered books and other curious publications, drawing strips for 
_[Girly Comic][]_ and _[Whores of Mensa][]_, 
and my web comic of the strangeness of modern life 
_[The Weekly Strip][]_. I also run comics
workshops, and I'm a founding member of the UK's longest-running comics
convention, [Caption][].
