long legs a nice, festive look, but would not stay up for more than an hour or so. I keep meaning to get her a pair of shoes from a quid-bin at a Cowley centre charity shop, but I've not got round to it yet.
(You have to cut out the sole of one shoe for her stand, and you need to get the heel height right too. Tricky.) You can really appreciate Susie's dramatic pose 
from this angle.  When she's not covered with tinsel, she almost looks like she's doing a tai-chi movement. We hadn't got very far with wrapping our presents 
by this stage, just the one or two we didn't want each other to see. </font></p></td>
