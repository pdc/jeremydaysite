an asparagus fern which drops leaves on my head when I'm in the bath. It grows prodigiously, I loop it over the shower 
curtain rail. It looks like water weed from a fish tank. One week I bought tiny glass fish from Honest Stationary (here, 
he said to me, you like tat like this) and a few months later I set them to swimming among the fronds of the asparagus fern. It's
hard to hang glass, it's so slippery, hence all the thread.</font></p></td>

Some of the dinosaurs are very cute; herbivorous, sweet natured, friendly. On the other hand, little clown Playmobil and
little outlaw Playmobil may have bitten off more than they can chew. They're very small dolls, and they have important cheap-ass 
playing piece committments, and when they're away I don't think the die-cast frog key ring who used to click will make a 
very responsible baby dinosaur-sitter. I've seen <i>Jurassic Park</i>. I know what happens when you mix frogs and dinosaurs, 
and the last thing I need is a sulky transexual dimetrodon about the house.</font></p></td>

Dodgy Tom and Surf-City Midge make friends with little Tommy Allen. Dodgy Tom is a standard cheap male doll -- he's called Tom 
because he reminds me of Tom Cruise in <i>Cocktail</i>. Little Tommy Allen came from the same market, but is actually
older than some of my friends. King of Ken <a href="http://www.manbehindthedoll.com"><b>Jef Beck</b></a> told me his name was actually Sunshine Family Steve,
 but by then he was already christened. Got a big video collection, haven't they? But if Tom and Midge have <i>7 Televison 
Commercials</i> among their videos, they can't be all bad.

Big-mouth dino (I have several, but his is the biggest mouth in proportion to the rest of his body) is bragging again, 
and embarassed owl, who dates back to when I was fourteen and everyone, but everyone gave me owls, the smaller and cuter, 
the better, finds it all to be a 
bit much, particularly as he has fetched up in front of the in-your-face safer sex promotion booklets again. Kinder Surprise 
motorcyclist isn't particularly interested either. He wishes he was chasing across the kitchen floor, as the great Kinder Egg 
in the sky intended.

Some years ago Selfridges in London produced some briefly famous christmas windows, featuring 
a wierd hallucinatory world of biology gone mad, distortions of scale, plants and animals mingling and growing over and
through each other. I was especially struck by a scene of tiny plastic frogs 
growing butterfly wings and flying away, and in the New Year, made some of my own. Over the years, the original set have lost wings, 
been given away to friends, and otherwise fallen victim to the wear and tear of life of my room. After all, they're not really frogs that can 
fly; they're frogs dreaming that they can fly.

I agonised over buying Special Photo Mission Action Man for almost a year, waiting and waiting for it to 
come down in price. It came down, but never far, and eventually I cracked. He's a camera; pull down his
trousers, open up his back, and a reel of 110 film goes inside. The little baby doll dates back to my childhood; 
I never much liked her as a kid, so she's nameless, though the dress is original. The shades are his, but the lippy and 
glitter were added by me; I don't like Action Man's bluff butchness. The sling is made from one of those excessive 
webbing bandages they give you when you give blood. It's clean!

	<td ><p> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>beautiful Hexadecimal</b> 
Hexadecimal was the first, and I think the finest of the bondage dollies. She's the random/chaotic virus from the 
<i>Reboot</i> computer animation series, and her fascinating 
career included turning Mainframe (the world) to stone, repainting Mainframe (with Paint), and becoming the gigantic 
multicoloured monster Nullzilla. The bitch-queen of Mainframe eventually ended her random, whimsical and
occasionally spriticidal life when she sacrificed herself to defeat the supervirus Daemon. She had two changes of
image (three, if you count the rather Geiger-ish web creature infected Hex); this is her classic red costume, and 
I think the only one ever made into a doll. The original character designs for <i>Reboot</i> were 
by two great <i>2000AD</i> artists, Brendan McCarthy and Ian Gibson, and are way more Sci-Fi than you normally see on kids' TV.

	<td ><p> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>i love kinder!</b> 
I want a toy, a surpise and chocolate! And, thanks to the miracles of Science and German thoroughness 
you can have all three, in one little chocolate egg. Not to mention a technical challenge, an expression 
of engineering cleverness in shiny plastic groovy pictures and tiny stickers usually too! I own a lot of kinder toys, in varying states of repair. I throw them out or use them for collage when they 
get sharp or tatty. One rather traumatic visit by a six year old lost me about 30 toys; they're not really aimed at children.
They're aimed at me. The little heart goes round and round when you wheel him along on 
his tiny plastic wheels.

Comics artist Terry Wiley has given me some truly odd gifts over the years, as well as many wonderful  
drawings. The gold bust is one from him; it came in an <i>enormous</i> box and adds a touch of class, don't you think?
The little phrenology portrait of me I'm also very fond of, I love the way my eyebrows look in it. 
That thing taking up a huge quantity of brain is <i>Blake's 7</i> which I was rewatching at the time. The strange 
little blue kitten looking askance at my head is another survivor from my childhood. His name is "Blue kitten" (I was 
a very literal namer of toys, also owning "Owl" and "Panda" -- but then, I only had <i>one</i> blue kitten and one panda, and only 
one owl that really mattered). He mews pathetically when you squeeze him.

I won gold alien playing Froggett, the best fairground game ever. You pay a quid for ten rubber frogs, and 
load them, one by one, onto a metal catapult, which you then hit with a big cartoon rubber mallet, catapulting 
the frog towards rotating lily-pad buckets over a pond of water and rubber frogs. The first two, you 
get the hit wrong and the frog leaps pathetically onto the ground. The next few, you hit as hard as you can, menacing 
the hanging toys, the frog-man, and the people on the opposite side of the stall! The last few you hit right,
and get enormous splashes if you lose and dumb toys if you win. It's good!

When <i>Risings of Summertown</i> closed, Summertown wailed and gnashed its teeth. Where now would we buy our crystal tat? 
Our water pistols and plastic snakes? Our tiny notepads and scented rubbers? Where would we buy our plastic coasters with 
pictures of comedy irrational colour chickens? On the bright side, they had a closing down sale, and I bought three lap dogs 
(dog heads on a limbless, comma-shaped body), gave two away and sat the third on top of the Theed Generator Micromachine play 
set I had been bought for Christmas. Darth Maul's eyes glow if you shine a light above him, but he's not generated any Theeds yet.

	<td ><p> <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><b>it's the fuzzy blue guy!</b> 
Well, the shiny plastic and exceedingly posable blue guy, anyway. This Nightcrawler's from <i>X-men Evolution</i>, the
animated series where they're all cute teenagers with cool clothes and funky teenaged traumas to deal with as well as 
Magneto and Mystique. It's a welcome change from the usual self-flagellatory grimmness of the X-types, though the lack of 
50-word narration panels also probably helps.

United by their disgust with the human race, Special Edition Agent Smith (<i>The Matrix</i>) and Mechagodzilla stare 
down from their perch high on the bookshelf. Wierd translucent matrix-printed Agent Smith I found, vastly reduced, at a 
comics convention where I'd been repeatedly failing to find any comics to buy in a hot, horrible dealer's hall. I claimed 
it was probably the perfectest toy for me ever, prompting a comment which inspired half my birthday presents that year: "No, the 
perfect toy for you would be a gin-dispensing sparkly plastic dinosaur camera."
