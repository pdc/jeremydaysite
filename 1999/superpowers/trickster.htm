<br><br>.<font color="#000000">Shot after dark, with a stroboscopic flash. Waving my arms while keeping my body still to ensure 
I remained all in one piece. Eyes closed to avoid the vagueness caused by blinking. Regret that I did not wear a blacker jumper. </font>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>i can kindle light in my shaking hands</b>
<br><br>.<font color="#000000">A quick flash committed my face and the radiator-like sides of the
bridge to film; then, once again, I stood very still, hands full of Habitat flower-lights (tiny, battery-
operated fairy lights), shaking them gently, while trying to keep my hands as still as possible. Same jumper: 
same night.</font></font></p>

<br><br>.<font color="#000000">A warm night, and a long wait for the tram. Stand over there and shake your head! says Matt. 
 I shake my hands, too, and the multiple exposures write over each other so that the blurriest parts of me are also the 
most clear.</font></p>

This one is tricky. With the film exposed, Matt slowly swung round, trying to keep the camera as steady as possible. 
When he reached me, he popped the flash, catching me and the bridge and making that real, but leaving the ghostly trails
 of streetlights etched across the film.</font></font></p>

<br><br>.<font color="#000000">Desolate shot under an underpass on a Sheffield canal. Matt finds a stain and stands me on it 
dissolving me through the power of double exposure. Help me, I'm melting!</font>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>i can talk to fairies</b>
<br><br>.<font color="#000000">What a palaver. The camera is on a tripod with the 
lens jammed open. The light is a maglight, being waved around by Matt. We don't know what 
the second trail is; possibly a reflection from Matt's eye, as he was dressed in non-reflective black. In this one 
you can see the background, as the exposure is so long; floods on Port Meadow.<font>

<td><p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>i have evil tentacle hands</b>
<br><br>.<font color="#000000">Walking along a pier at night, we came upon a ghastly,abandoned ghost-train ride. It was 
lit up green; Matt photographed me lurching out of the shadows using available light. In the slow exposure, 
my hand duplicated, stretched, shuddered and became something other.</font>

<br><br>.<font color="#000000">From colour to sepia in one easy step between cameras, I travelled back in time. Note 
my period dress. The 
sepia film overexposes fast, leaving the world a little burned out, but this does mean that it misses a lot of fussy modern 
detail. You too can travel back in time if you find the right sculpture on Brighton seafront.</font>
