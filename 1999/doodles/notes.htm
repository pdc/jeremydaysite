 <b>Producing the doodles</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">
 These doodles were all produced at work, usually during meetings or while on the phone. Little thought is involved; 
I am quite able to concentrate on other things while doodling like this, in fact in some ways it helps, because I'm 
looking at something which requires pretty much no thought, I listen quite hard while doodling. This is quite
distinct to drawing, scripting, or cartooning. If I'm doing that, especially in a meeting, I'm not going to be listening to anything!
Possibly this distinction is only visible from the inside of my skull.</font></p>

 <b>Photographing the doodles</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">
The doodles were photographed using a Mavica FD75. Light is the ambient light in the room 
(anti-glare fluorescent lighting plus morning sunshine  through a small window). The Mavica's happy
with distances of 1-3cm providing I give it time to focus and the light level's high enough, 
so that's how close I am to the doodles, photographing them. They are reproduced here far larger 
than they were drawn, typically an enlargement of 400-500%. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>Post-production</b></font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">They didn't need much. I photographed them at 640x480, so there's been a bit of a shrink, and 
they came in at a slightly lower light-level than I like, so they've been brightened, sharpened and 
smoothed but not in a particularly clever way, just your basic scrub-up.</b> </font></p>
