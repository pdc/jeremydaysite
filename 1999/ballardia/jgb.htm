<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Beachcombings from the terminal beach</font></h4>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard had
seen the bomb. It smashed through his childhood, exposing the guts of
the houses to the prurient sky. The inside fell outside in a sudden
gash of light, the walls lurched together like overfriendly drunks and
in the morning the streets had given birth to corpses. Internal walls 
indecently exposed to the brain-white sky, wallpaper
already peeling in the damp smoky air, torn rooms spilling out into
the rubble-strewn street and suddenly! his simple curiosity hardened into
interest. He stared in awe at respectable walls indecently
assaulted by war and felt a vague
stirring, a first hint of the rapist's fantasy that the victim invites
the assault, that in some sense the houses had wished for the bomb, had
dreamed of the bomb, had been waiting all their lives for that defining
moment of violence and violation</font></p> 



<p><font face="arial,
helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was screaming and the sound of
running; war came in waves of violence and boredom. Towards the end
a bright white light marked the bombs falling, Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, but long before that bright moment Ballard knew that the world was ending.
Something had burnt it into his brain, but in the tumult of death and
dreams and captivity and corpses he could no longer remember when he had
first learnt his one defining lesson. He simply knew it. The
world was ending. It was only a question of time.
</font></p>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The thought of his
impending doom weighed on his mind. How would it come? A
bland, impersonal decision, a there-and-gone accident, the infinitely patient
creep of disease? Or would he get the disaster he deserved? What if he could chose? 
What would he chose? Crushing, drowning, fire, dessication? Or something more special? Once he started it
didn't take him long to work up to the stranger, more exotic deaths. Perhaps a
wind would come from nowhere and tear the flesh from his bones. Perhaps an elaborate environmental
disaster would destroy rains and he would die chasing mirages and saltfish.
Perhaps time would crack and bend and separate, crystallising the world
around him, leaving him entombed in a jewelled refraction of time. But
Ballard had a friend, and cared for him (even though they were all
inevitably going to die) and that reminded him death was not just an exercise
in glamour. In an attempt at discipline he forced himself to think only about
tedious, unglamorous disasters, the ones that simply come, sometimes, and sweep you
away; or your friend, or the man down the street, or an unlucky subcontinent.
He numbered them in his mind: weather, poverty, accident, success,
failure, advertising, ennui, love. Perhaps he thought too hard. Instead
of bringing him to a better understanding of the ordinariness of death, his
numbing list of ordinary horrors became suffused with a strange
glamour.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the end he had
to conclude that there was no such thing as an unglamorous
death.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It made him sad,
though, when he thought of his friend, or his father and
mother, wherever they were. He could not forget that in every shining image of
glorious disaster a lost friend was curled, like a poisonous
seed in a sweet fruit, which, when pared down, flesh from flesh, strip
by strip, symbol behind symbol, was nothing more than the
mourning echo of his own death buried inside him, waiting for its
moment. Each morning, when he saw his friend, he bit back the words: 
"I grieve for your irrevocable death." Once
inside a black night the words had come to him and they had grown and
grown until he could think of almost nothing else.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time passed,
measured in other people's deaths.</font></p>

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard found
the best expression of his life in disaster areas, in the places ruined
by bombs and blood and war. He took pleasure in the stunted gestures of
the semi-survivors who populated these places because in them he saw
the reflection both of a world stunned by the knowledge of its impending
doom and of his own inadequacies. He wandered there, remote and
unafraid. He only felt anything when his worried guardians chased after him; then he
only felt guilty, for putting them in danger.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was a cold
winter, and the earth seemed as hard as ice. People were starving, but
he felt this remotely, as if their pain were a seismic vibration deep in
the earth, impersonal and
unsettling. He felt more for the bomb-holes, spilt fuel staining
the earth like mineral blood, than for their corpses. One day,
wandering in a blasted space, featureless and bewildering, he
slipped, and his hand went straight through the crust of what he had thought was
ground. Underneath was water, black and endless, and as he lay stretched
out on the ice, gut cold with meltwater, he saw the terrible
fragility of it all, not just the starving people, the poisoned
earth, not just his own life and not just theirs but the fragility of
all life, the implausible sequence of moments that had brought him and
the whole world here and only here. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shivering, he had
withdrawn his arm with infinite patience and eased carefully back off
the ice until he was safely on firm ground and then had gone home again,
to the careful eyes of the women who looked after him. But every moment
after he walked on the earth as if it were water, and with
each step he felt the ice give beneath him, the pitch forward into
water, the shock of the cold, the mercury ooze into his lungs, the
slow tumble downwards into the black depths. For a while it
distressed him, but he learnt to live with it, just as he learnt to live
with everything, and after a while it became simply part of him, something 
he could say; I am a man preoccupied by the vivid memory of my own death.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the moment he
had escaped, he had tried to mythologise it, writing over
the memories again and again, trying to make the
lake an important rite of passage which
had brought him a true and adult understanding of the world. But his
mind tottered, unconvinced. Against every screaming
monkey-instinct he knew that the true lesson had been at
the bottom of the lake. Everywhere he saw corpses, graveyards, scars left 
by violence and accidental death. So many spaces in
his life once occupied by people now held only a tombstone,
pale and immaculate. It seemed that the dead far
outnumbered the living. It was hard not to feel like there had been a
party and he had not been invited, or that he was stood outside some
mysterious club, refused entrance.</font></p> 

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard lived
through his childhood and left for a safer, colder place. There were no
more corpses, or if there were they were bundled away, quickly and
discreetly, and often burned, as if the chilly people were desperately
trying to keep warm. When they heard where he grew up, people were
suddenly sympathetic, or, if he was lucky, horror shut them up entirely.
He paid them no attention, lost in devising ways back. For
years he tried to get back there, escape the cold world where it was
all alright to be cold and detached and sane and sensible, and swim back
up that warm amniotic river of his childhood, where he had lived among
blood and corpses and once stared down a general with only a balsa-wood
plane to protect him. At least, he claimed to himself that he was trying
to go back, but his efforts were perhaps too minute to be noticed by any
detector less sensitive than his own brain.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, there
were always distractions. Women, for example. His life was scattered with
them; lonely women, older women, other people's wives. They tangled up
with his memories of wartime women, perpetually looking to the horizon
and imagining the world through other people's eyes. The women he
remembered had always been absorbed and distracted, unresponsive
mannequins mimicking life in response to his incoherent distress. Used
to always coming second to some remote disaster, he was perpetually
surprised by the interest the women showed in him, on hard narrow beds
or cheap scratchy blankets or the stinking plastic of a cheap back-seat.
He lay back and thought of bombsites, Japanese soldiers, his mother's
lipstick. He could not decide whether what he was doing was an
experiment or an act of worship; but his detachment seemed only to enourage them.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When he decided 
finally to get involved, he recognised it as an act of submission.</font></p> 

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard knew
that love was doomed. A corpse had frightened him when
he was young and left him with the rudest habit of all; he
could not stop staring through women's skin. Instead of 
a sonnet to his mistress' eyes, he was inclined to celebrate 
more hidden charms; liver and kidneys, lungs and spleen
all awoke his intimate curiosity, but above all he venerated (as
was only right and true for a lover) the heart. Pulled through the skin
of his lover by a sudden impulse of desire he was gripped abruptly by a
disturbing fantasy, quite surgical in nature. What if, he thought, what
if he could take this woman, his lover, wrap her in the gentle
caress of general anaesthetic, take his surgical
instruments (at this time, Ballard was a medical student) cut open her chest, and press his lips
to her beautiful, beating heart? He imagined that he was 
looking down at her sleeping body (in fact, she seldom spent all night
at his place) and wondered if she would understand the perversely thrilling fantasy.
Possibly she would, there were
all manner of fascinating women at university, but nevertheless, love was
doomed, just as everything was doomed. When she distracted him too much, he went
out to the big American bases to remind himself how thoroughly doomed
everything was, though not as a protester. Something in
him always left protests dying on his lips.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afterwards he went
back to his anatomical goddesses, the corpses he dissected and
the women he made love to and the women he remembered, writing them
over and over until they became one glorious whole, glistening with
blood and pregnant with disaster, riding a dream of glorious oblivion
into the red dawn of the end of the world.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much later he
thought about the women he had envisaged then, jewel-eyed prophetesses
of coming doom, remote and powerful in their understanding, and realised
that he was being unfair to women by making them strange godesses, and awarding 
all the mediocre roles to men. Shouldn't women have
the right to  explore the crippling banality of modern life too? Shouldn't they
have the opportunity to become ordinary, evil?</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He scraped a
handful of traits together. He usually called her Catherine. 
And then there was the accident, but I'm getting ahead of myself here.</font></p>

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard had a
peculiar way of worshipping women. Others put them pedestals, made
queens and angels of them; or alternatively harpies and monsters,
predators on the flesh of men. Ballard gave them the wheel of his
car, and lay back in his seat as they went to hell. In their own submissions to
 anxieties and obligations he saw his relationship with
the world. He looked to them for guidance, tracing the pattern of
approaching disaster in distracted eyes, reddened or shadowed, in
firm-set lips, painted to resemble a open wound. When they heard the bad news or had
to move on or drove into walls, he felt for how their suffering defined a
new role for them, watching at a slight distance, head cocked, eyes
unblinking, trying to learn. In the driving seat, a thousand glamorous
John the Baptists were howling in the desert. He heard them as he slept,
and when he was awake, he lived in the shadow of his own
approaching death. Disaster was coming. He read it in their eyes, he
read in in his dreams, and he wondered, as they must have wondered from time to time,
whether it was worth fighting it any more; whether their might not be a
better way, in willing submission to the dooms and disasters
visited by outside forces.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was nothing
particularly masochistic about the urge. To think that the suffering was
what it was all about was to miss the point entirely. And of course the
concept of noble suffering is ridiculous. Suffering is undignified,
unpleasant, undesirable. Suffering exists to give us something to move
away from. So why the irresponsible urge to play in the blast zone? He
walked around the thought again and again, unable to escape it, unable to
explain it. The urge had a white strangeness to it, like long-forgotten
bones on some distant desert beach, as alien and familiar as the
contours of his own skull. And it wasn't about suicide, either. He had
no desire to die.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or was it that he
thought his death would not taste as sweet if it were not freely given?
</font></p> 

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard was
not a hero. He might dream of heroic savings and dramatic rescues as he
lingered around wrecks and wreckages but he understood that these were
dreams. No-one would be cured, no-one could be saved. He had two hands,
and a modicum of training. He was no more afraid than the next person,
he was inventive and intelligent. But he would never save anyone, and
the people he helped (the people he chose to help, that was, for even
when it seems like the only possible action, we still make a choice, to
heal or hurt, help or harm) were saved as much for his own
gratification as for their good. For what chance, in the final account,
did he have of rescuing anyone? Death coloured the air in front of his
eyes; it hung like a spectre over healthy children, vibrant sportswomen,
happy couples. It stained the air red, it paralysed his attempts to
force his will on the world, and so he could not be a hero.
He was a bystander, a subliminal extra gone in the blink
of the eye, bottom of the bottom of the list. Crying boy, man in black,
irritable man, lonely guy, distant figure... he
played them all, all the time turning a jealous eye towards the
plum roles he coveted, the ones everyone always played so  well: 
screaming man; falls out of window; dying man; dead man. Man on
fire.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That, he thought,
through some gloom-addled head lost in a chaos of spires and archaic,
meaningless privileges, was the problem with modern life. All these
disasters waiting to happen and only ever space for one hero.
</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 70s were
the hey-day of disasters. This was before the endless parade of
cyclones and famines and massacres had hardened our hearts to a cold,
modern temper. Now only the most abstract suffering touches our jaded
minds; mutant pet suffering, the whiplash rollercoaster of soap opera drama, the
spectral pain of CGI-ed dino-constructs; but back then almost anything could
provoke panic and horror and the daily news was examined as carefully
for potential distress as an intimate chat with a favourite maiden aunt.
The papers were a minefield of dark hints and chilly speculation. The
daily navigation through murders and environmental disaster, though
sixties concrete shearing away from its foundations, collapsing
bridges and back-flipping oil-rigs, black slicks of death and chill
hints of homelier horrors, of murders and beatings, of racist attacks
and the flat-iron brutality of domestic violence; and over
it all the mother of all disasters hanging like the smog of the world's
ending, the bomb. H-bomb, death-bringer, world-killer, life-ender,
the disaster no-one could protect us from, not even Steve
McQueen.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A walk in the
woods, a department store, a city flat, an amusement park;
everywhere was a fit environment for disaster in the 70s. But the bomb
was no escapable day at the earthquakes, it was disaster on world-scale,
global extinction, the end of everything. Yet at the same time it reduced 
to the individual level, a cosy, personal death (we all knew the details) 
extinction gift-wrapped
for one, or two, or twenty, or a hundred, or a hundred thousand, or a
million. The bomb broke a barrier of scale; it made
extinction global and suddenly the end of the world, the
favourite refrain of the desperate and insane, became our reality.
Global extinction is an insane idea, implausible, pure science fiction
nonsense. But when the bomb came it broke that fictional barrier and
with a shuddering step the sky broke open above us and the end of the
world came into sight, as life took a first lumbering step towards
oblivion. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the
unspeakable out in the open, an avalanche of apocalypses followed; death
by pollution, by global warming, by overpopulation, by underpopulation,
by deforestation, by climatic change, by carmageddon, by nuclear
terrorism. Ballard saw it all on television while he was convalescing, 
recovering from a car crash. Not
one he'd had  himself, he had only found out about it by chance, but other people's
disasters still felt more real to him than his own. He stirred himself
and wrote a story about falling down through the cracks in modern life.
He called it <i>The Concrete Island</i>. He wrote, "These days one
needed a full-scale emergency kit built into ones brain, plus a crash
course in disaster survival, real and imagined." He felt embarrassed, as
if he had just told a stranger about a harmless but eccentric fetish. He
found being harmless hard to come to terms with. Much harder than coming
to terms with being doomed.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or perhaps he was just 
irritated because everyone was in love with disaster nowadays.</font></p>

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard looked 
down from the window of the light aircraft, skimming over a world buried under
concrete, cars and people, almost too excited to breathe. The accidents 
were getting closer; this time it had been family. Next time, maybe, 
it would be his turn. He was tired of standing aside and looking on, his smug game of
being a bystander, an observer. He wanted something more, but not the thrusting
binary choice of being victim or hero, even if those roles existed,
even if those roles had any meaning at all. Ballard had been up close
enough to disaster to smell its breath and he knew hero was just another
name for victim. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every disaster is
cluttered with gore-drunk voices: seize the moment, stick together, lead,
follow, or get out of the way, find out what you're made of, sort it
out, cope, control, move, work, live, pay. Ballard picked through these
voices like a demented fortune teller, turning up the same figures again
and again; organisers, profiteers, business men, leaders, generals.
People with simple relationships to each other, and to the world and its
problems. They exert their will; the world and everyone in it bends to
their needs. They build up their empires, solid as a pyramid, strong as a
private army... and they are just as likely to succeed or fail, die or
live, rise or fall as the wanderer with his eyes on
the sky. Their faces and names are interchangeable, the people who are
leading, following and getting out of the way. Their actions are as
precise and meaningless as the migrations of temperate birds. They
exist, and they might be right. He tried always to be scrupulously
fair to them; after all, they might have a point.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But, deep in his 
blood-filled heart he knew they understood nothing, that they would die, 
their children would die, society as we know it would end, and all their
struggle would come to nothing. At the end of the world as they knew it,
would he volunteer to build civilisation in the ashes? To be Adam, or Eve? 
To scrape a life out of the dust? No, he would rather lie back on some 
bewildered sundune and drink his last flask of martinis under a nuclear sunset,
 thank you very much. He wrote it down, with the nervous
half-smile of someone telling a joke in bad taste that half his
company will probably not get, but instead his twisted words found
root in a broad seam of submissive laziness running through society.
Under his transforming pen, laziness became a glorious submission to
circumstance, indecision a delicate sense tuned to the necessities of
the moment, ambivalence a balanced response to the contradictory demands
of the world. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But he
knew that the coming disaster would not be satisfied with ambivalent
submission. Nothing less than passionate devotion would be enough,
nothing more than worship, and love and sacrifice, Nothing less than the
worst the modern world could offer, served up as a satisfying aperitif
to the end of it all. He began counting off sacrifices to impending
doom. Experimental advertising, check. Artist's communities, check.
Award-winning architecture, check. Experimental psychotherapy, check. A
successful career and a happy home life, check. Gated communities,
check. Road-widening schemes...</font></p> 

<center><img src="images/tinyhand.gif" alt="...the greatest act of love was to open her chest, and kiss her still-beating heart..."></center>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J G Ballard looked up
to see that years had gone by without apocalypse arriving, and that
 belief in the steadiness of the world had seeped
in through his temples, despite the inevitability of doom, despite the bombs
and the accidents and the corpses he never seemed to be able to stop
seeing. But car crashes, he reflected, stroking his steering wheel, really had 
what it took. A life spent waiting for a disaster and this is the closest most of
us get, this dislocating moment cut through life,
toothshaken and spineshuddered, a little disaster for one, just enough
to send you back to the day-to-day of it with newly nervous feet and horrible 
images caught behind the eyes. (Mist beading a racing green door, grass ground
into the space between buckled door and buckled frame, windscreen
flattened into pale leather, an explosion of browning rust, a shoe,
a muddied scarf, a string of bloodstained pearls.) When his eyes close he
sees it. When he thinks of love he sees it. When he smells the iron in
her blood he sees it. So small, and yet so
terrifying; apocalypse for one, nouvelle-cuisine style.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps the small
disasters (the crash, the crunch, the sudden spasm, the time between
hitting and opening your eyes) perhaps it's an inocculation, staving
off the big one, keeping the world-killers at bay with a steady
stream of small sacrifices, bloody and intense. Or maybe that moment of 
submission to the small disaster is about winning favour to
be traded in later; good credit for when the big bombs really begin to
rain down. Or maybe it's more along the line of sympathetic magic;
fucking the corpses of cars to bring the world to the disaster it must,
surely, fervently wish for. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He started the engine, 
yanking the car into gear, pulling out without looking into a blare of horns. 
Impossible to rationalize it, his endless, bloody, exciting flirtation with 
disaster. Impossible to understand it, the disaster always looking
down with greedy eyes, brandishing asteroids and microbes,
deviant weather-sytems and penicillin-resistant infections,
immunodeficiency and genetic contamination. Impossible to escape it, and 
impossible to escape the knowledge that escape is impossible.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He drove east, and made 
good time; the traffic was light, and not even the speed cameras noticed his passing.
