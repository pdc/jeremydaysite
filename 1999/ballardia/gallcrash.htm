Crash"></p> <table width="500"> <tr> <td> <p><font
face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><small>Oh, <i>Crash</i>. Notorious, 
outrageous, uncompromising. Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean collide 
with lesbian sex and acid-fueled freeway sodomy; James gets 
in touch with his damaged self. Interestingly, when this was remade as a film, 
Cronenberg gave it a happy ending, the couple brought together through their shared 
fetish. In the book, the car divides them, and the hero ends alone, starring at a
 vision of endelss concrete; another apocalypse, maybe? Possibly, but only for the 
individual mind. 
</small></font></p> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica,
Sans-serif"><small>I originally read <i>Crash</i> in a train carriage, while changing into 
an evening dress. That wasn't this edition; it was the student standard Paladin, with the 
fetish picture on it. The picture on this Panther paperback is another Foss (if you look closely, you can see the F monogram) 
and is distinctive for being one of his very rare book covers showing a 
human. Ramming the point home, Panther added their own subtitle; <i>a brutal, erotic novel</i>, perhaps 
by way of a warning.</small></font></p>
