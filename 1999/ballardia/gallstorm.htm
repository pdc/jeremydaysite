Storm bird, Storm dreamer"></p> <table width="500"> <tr> <td> <p><font
face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><small>This second offering from the <i>New Worlds SF</i> series (No. 168, 1966) features 
a really, really strange J G Ballard story, in which Britain is under siege by gigantic birds. The birds were killed by 
glistening, seductive pesticides, and people mourned their passing. And then returned, like a judgement from the sea ... 
though the bare facts of the story are the stuff of B movies after midnight, Ballards transformational touch strikes from 
them a strange story of broken humanity, grieving, madness, and the glamour of lost causes, startling, mystical and magic.
</small></font></p> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica,
Sans-serif"><small>Thankfully the artist signed the picture, as New Worlds forgot to credit K Roberts for this 
lovely cover picture. Inside, J Cawthorn has profusely illustrated the story with oddly evocative sketches, which 
look a lot like they were drawn in magic marker.</small></font></p>
