<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the party veteran of the costa del sol</font> </h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monday night,
arriving in Malaga, a BritloutTM stumbling across the aisle as the plane
banks for touchdown, a soft German voice, thin and high with outrage and
anxiety: please stop that, he says, please. Please stop
harassing me. Across the aisle a stylish clubber too rich to be the
eighteen-year-old her hi-tech dance gear suggests giggles with her
neighbours about how he always does this, she can't believe it, and her
last husband he always used to do exactly the same thing, isn't it
funny? Small, brunette and understated, they have obviously not been doing
this as long as she has and she smiles at them with condescending
chumminess, the party veteran of a thousand drunken binges along the
Costa del sol. As her husband lurches drunkenly towards her, and the
stewards converge like underweight bouncers, she smiles fondly in his
direction, blinding white teeth between lips the gleaming pink of
exposed intestines. The plane lurches and he collapses
uncontrollably into the inconveniently empty seat beside me, face red
and fat to bursting with drink. He looks and smells as if he is cooking
from inside. The stewards try to cut their losses and despite my no-no-no
rays say, sit there if you want to sir, it's OK sir, but another flash
of teeth from the woman who definitely doesn't want her hi-tech designer
steel-rimmed hand-finished urban-combat platform trainers stained by her
husband's vomit silences them. "Go on Del," she says, "Get back to your
seat, we're nearly down." She watches him back with a fond smile. The
German voice rises up again in thin, ineffectual protest. Under her
peroxide mane, her face has the wizened brown cunning of an Indian
monkey.</font></p> <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2">We arrive at the <i>aerporto</i>, ground skidding under our feet, evening sky
too luminous and blue. It's just the last in a series of stopping
stones; London, Heathrow, Malaga. Next stop, Calypso. </font></p>

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the violet highway </font></h4>


<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dianique meets us
at the <i>aerporto</i>. She speaks English to us and French to her husband,
subtitling every warm phrase of broken English with a sharp barrage of
rapid French. We walk past fleets of Mercedes and BMWs gleaming wetly in
the belly of the airport car park. At the end of the row, Dianique's car,
a veteran Renault in dusty blood, lurks in the shadows behind a pillar.
We trade the usual pleasantries as we ooze into the back seat, caught in a 
tangle of flattened tenses and abrupt word-substitutions, every phrase
brutally direct and personal. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we pull out
onto the coastal strip, I slide on my violet glasses to dim the lights
and put something between myself and the roads. Neon lights
explode into violent colour, the cars drag redder-than-red brake lights
into the night, and the street lamps diffuse into indigo haze. The
car judders as we leave the feeder road, trying to cope with
four people and luggage, but I'm gone in remote and
beautiful on the violet highway.</font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the broken satellite
decoder</font></h4>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The key fits the
lock, the house hasn't been burgled, the lights are working and there's
water in the taps and the toilets. The house doesn't feel empty so much
as stopped; I open every door I can find and the air still feels trapped. 
Neal heads for the television, I go for the kettle, filling the musty air
 with english coughs. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial,
helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sit staring at the blank screen, sipping 
overstrong tea and talking in short, awkward sentences. Something has fried the 
controls of the satellite decoder, extinguishing the red
unblinking eye which should have given us promise of the Sci-Fi channel
Sky movies and MTV. Neal fiddled with it for about an hour, but it remained 
stubbornly broken, its screen flat and dead as the shiny black shell of a
blind-womans' visor. We go in, we go out. We wander into the kitchen, make coffee, 
forget the coffee. Wait until saying something is unavoidable, talk and then 
listen, wait until saying something is unavoidable and then talk again. 
Neal smokes, I do unpleasant things with the joints in my hands, time passes. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It would be better
if we didn't, but eventually we have to go to bed. We set up hasty camps
in the gloom. A sleeping bag, a scavenged pillow, and a ring of bags, discarded clothes,
and other totemic
objects are not enough and all through the night we hear each other
getting up and trying to do something which will make the room safe
enough to sleep in. I pull my bags in tighter around my head, cover the
pillow with my grubbiest t-shirt. Curl up as tight as I can. Screw my eyes
shut. It's not enough. </font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the coral hillsides</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coastal strip
is a constant repeating pattern. Blinding tower blocks, villas crowded
tight as tombs in a Scottish cemetery, sudden clusters of estate agents,
casinos, and polyglot restaurants, new developments, re-developments,
then back to the villas again. We're going to Marbella today, riding the 
coastal road in the
pitiless 11o'clock sunshine. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial,
helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Towards the sea, the tower blocks jut up
into the painful blue sky, white as refridgerators, each balcony a black
morgue-drawer waiting for an occupant. Inland, villas and apartment
blocks crawl up the sides of the mountains, stucco scabies creeping out of 
the armpits of the hills. Scrawny worker-cranes tend rectangular
skeletons, cement-block walls blossoming between girders softening in
the heat, stucco crawling down the outer surface, a final protective
layer. Like an expanding reef, the buildings are colonising the
mountains, setting up their own environment of palm-trees and
sprinklers, lemons and swimming pools, dogs and ants and starlings: and
deep inside their gleaming shells, the creators of this bright new world,
brown-faced and white-haired, temperate aches easing in the
Mediterranean sun, far from rain and whining families, the soft-bodied
inhabitants of the Costa del sol. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back at the villa
we close the door and collapse in the 3 o'clock heat.
Measure out the rest of the day in cups of coffee and cigarettes. Watch
bad television, think about how much we have to do and if we can
avoid doing it. Find an episode of The Simpsons neither of us have ever
seen, Ai Carumba and incomprehensible high-speed Spanish in juddery
over-saturated colour. Outside something is chirruping in a high,
desperate voice. The only other sound is the soft dribble of the
<i>urbanization</i>'s swimming pool. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the silence, I
suddenly hear the traffic on the coastal road, a hum so constant I had
mistaken it for silence. It hums through the night in a swirl of white
dust and exhaust fumnes, a tarmac groove worn by endless leisured tires
driving from bar to golf-course to chinese-indian-mexican restaurant to
casino to estate agent to bar in Mercedes and BMWs and Lotuses and
gleaming sports utility vehicles, a loop-track playing on through the
eternal summer.</font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the vision of the mortuary</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wake up in thick, 
stifling air. I was dreaming,
repetitive and horrible; we were future archeologists investigating the
huge stone tombs of long-dead superheroes. The caves were flooded with
bright lights, each enormous cavern filled from floor to ceiling with
the stacked-up dead, each grave a heavy stone drawer we laboriously pull
open to examine the remains; ashes, a possession, a battered logo. The
drawers are just shy of solid blocks, only a small depression in the lid
to take the relics. I'm reminded of cheap chocolate bars, Trios or
Clubs, the sort whose solid ridge of chocolate you can chew off before
starting on the biscuit beneath. We find a cave of super-kids graves, you can tell
 because the drawers are smaller; the relics are allocated
body-space, for symbolic reasons. I pull one open, it's the
grave of Superboy, I pick up his logo, it's metal, scored and
scorched. I wonder how they cremated him. Superman, perhaps, with his
heat vision. I make notes, glance down at the drawers. There are
hundreds of them. It's the find of a lifetime. I wake up bored, tired,
and sick with disgust and hate. I turn over and drag at the curtains,
and it's another beautiful day.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside the villas
settle back into the hillside, well-tended walled tombs, windows
black behind their bars. Everything is closed, locked, turned inwards;
sealed tombs and private memorial gardens, respectable and decorous. On
the far hillside, another white apartment block is going up, a hygienic white
morgue waiting for the next outbreak of wealth and old age to fill it
up. Nothing is moving anywhere; the view has the eerie perfection of a
promotional brochure for an exclusive graveyard. A dog barks, and then
another, and then another, each a little Anubis sitting at the gate of
his long-dead master. Bodies embalmed in sun-oil, laxatives and
preservatives, they sit in funereal splendour in their dark inner
chambers, sangria in one hand and remote control in the other, 
blank eyes glazed with flickering television glow.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stagger out into
the light trying to blink the dead out of my eyes. Neal is distracted, head
full of lawyers, papers, problems. We talk listlessly about fiction, and 
when he goes I try to finish <i>Cocaine Nights</i> for maybe an hour and
then go through the cupboards until I find the real coffee and make
myself a pot. I go back to 
<i>Cocaine Nights</i> but it's a disappointment. I'm after hard drugs, buggery
and cataclysmic disaster and all I get is designer shop-lifting, petty
crime and the inevitability of exclusive property developments. I yawn my way
to another pot of coffee, duck into the dark kitchen to
find the milk. The draining board is lost under washing up, the fridge
foul with rotting lemons, and suddenly I know exactly how I will be spending
the next few hours.</font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the butterfly path</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's another beautiful day.
I try to finish another book, fail, drink coffee, make desultory
attempts at cleaning. Neal has to go, and I keep daytime
television on for company. Wonder and worry. At around eleven I
crack and head for the beach. </p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five minutes away as 
the starling flies,
the beach is clearly not intended to be accessible to non car drivers. 
 Once upon a time access was
through an underpass beneath the coast road, melted now into another building site, wire and warnings and tiny diggers
guarding its entry. I cast around, and find a footbridge in a twist of
litter, a no-entry sign and a bollard barring vehicles from its skinny ramp. 
I imagine tribes of bewildered
drivers of anorexic cars squeezing onto the bridge, desperate for that costa del  
beach. Up on the bridge the air is a sauna of exhaust fumes, damp and
acrid. A greyish haze terminates the coast road at the limits of vision.
I look in one direction, and then the other. Only the physical act of
turning differentiates the two views. I swim through the thick air to
the other side, heart pounding and sweat on pale skin as I drop below
the polluting haze, and follow a small road wavering down between
clinics and restaurants and apartments. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end of the
road the blocked-off underpass, and a thin trickle of foul water
draining from it to disappear behind a nest of wheelie bins. I follow it
into a dusty ditch, the rattle of dried weeds in the wind, the smell of
sun-baked mud and foetid water, birds scattering at my approach, and a
path opening up through weeds and reeds and unfamiliar bushes, foot-worn
yellow dust. Everything is golden, dust the colour of yellow ochre,
darker where it becomes mud, golden light filtered through sun-yellowed
reeds, opaque water the colour of butterscotch. Mating butterflies
whirl in the dust-hot air, birds scatter like black confetti, canes and
reeds rattle like bones and small things make abrupt scuttling noises. I
walk carefully, trying not to disturb the smooth water and the stagnant
air, thinking about silent places, Ian McEwan short stories, <i>River's
Edge</i>, averting my eyes from imaginary corpses, trying not to disturb
my lurking horrors. The water deepens and the reeds open out and the
air dissolves from golden to blinding white, to the thin smell of salt
and seaweed and the soft hardly-there beat of Mediterranean waves. Almost alone on
this thin, mean beach; just a dog barking, a long way down the beach,
and two people, slowly walking. Under my feet, a thin column of water
dissolves into the beach, snaking through the litter (wire, a can, a
washed-up tree in an attitude of awkward desolation) to bury itself in
green rocks and black surf, and the hammered silver of the Mediterranean
sea beyond that stretching out into nothingness. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I pull my feet from the clinging mud
and head for firmer sand. Pick up stones and let them fall again.
Look out to sea for a horizon invisible in the haze. Inland, a thousand dark 
cave-mouths in the
white cliff-faces of the sea-front apartments stare down, roofs
bristling with satellite dishes, daggery green ornamental palms guarding
every door. </font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the ultimate whiteness</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm still cleaning
when Neal gets back. I don't like to clean with someone
else watching.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cleaning. There is a
satisfaction in it, despite the tedium, and the muck, and the unendable
nature of the task. To take an environment (or, in extreme cases, an
ecosystem), and so comprehensively force your will upon it; to watch the
march of entropy retreat beneath your hands. It's like a magic trick; a
little skill, a twist of cloth, an important secret, and hey presto! a
bathroom appears. But the resemblance to magic is unfortunate. Each
stroke of my cloth is the fruit of a thousand wrong turns on the path to
the ultimate whiteness. Each scrubbing action contains every similar
motion that has gone before, and all the learning from that, all the
experience of that. In my time, I've done a lot of scrubbing.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I start in a
corner, forcing the dirt back in a tide, working with a section large
enough that it feels like an achievement, small enough that I can reach
it without moving too much. First pass removes large loose pieces, dead
insects and other solids. I shake the cloth into the bag between each
pass, small shiny carapaces sticking to my gloves. At this point,
regular rinsing of the cloth is crucial. Second pass attacks the ground
in, or sticky, dirt. Cleaning fluid, which ideally should contain bleach
<i>and</i> detergent, is now required. I pour a quantity of the cleaning fluid
directly onto the floor, and quickly smear the thick, over-fragranced
liquid across the area to be cleaned. It needs a few seconds now, to
loosen the dirt. The water needs to be as hot as you can stand for this,
so I run the hot tap until the cloth is steaming in my hands. Then I
start to take up the dirt, using a scooping motion to remove as much of
the detergent and dirt mix as possible with each stroke. Each cloth full
of dirt goes under the hot tap, swirl of bubbled grey down the plug hole
and then back to the floor. On stubborn bits, repeat the process. The
third pass, a scrub with a different, cleaner cloth impresses the
cleanness upon the area. You can look on it as a rinse, but I tend to
think of it more along the lines of varnishing, and my tools vary
accordingly. In this case I'm using Vim, scrubbed in with a brush, and
then wiped off with a hot cloth. The Vim stays in the grouting between
the tiles, but wipes off the tiles themselves. (It was in the cupboard,
I usually work with what I can find in the cupboard.) But lots of
different things can be used for this final stage, from simple clean hot water
to high-cost hygienic wipes. I wipe the surface with a stray tea-towel
at the end to dry it, and there is a clean, white space on the floor.
From then on, it's only a question of expanding that space until it
fills the room. I pick up my tools; cloth, liquids, brush and gel,
move backwards into the next space that needs cleaning, and start again,
pulling the whiteness out, forcing the dirt back, moving the bathroom
slowly from entropic slide to steady state, aided in my task by arcane
super-heroes; Vim and Harpic, Flash and Dettol, the mighty Domestos, and
of course, the invincible Toilet Duck.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I fill another
black plastic bag, ruin another pair of gloves, weaken and grow strong,
shout in disgust and laugh weakly. It's nothing special you get at
the end, just a clean floor, not even perfect; the best you can ever
achieve is good enough. There's always more cleaning you can do. It's in
the nature of the task. My father was obsessed with finishing
cleaning, always telling us to go back and do the floor again, scrub the
sink again (10p off the pocket money, 20p off the pocket money), wipe
the mirror again, never really understanding that there is always
another dog hair, always another smear on the glass.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm still working
when Neal gets back, but he doesn't come and watch. When I come
downstairs he tells me what a great job I've done and I try to explain
my ambivalence; but all I can think of is Peter O'Toole in <i>Lawrence of
Arabia</i>, blood from his humiliations seeping through his shirt (sick
stink of rubber gloves on my hands, pin-ache in my elbows) demanding to
be released from his rank and privilege (feminist, university girl, and
a proper job, too, I'm no scrubber) because you don't understand, <i>I
enjoyed it</i>. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I step out into
the white four'o'clock glare and listen to the
silence, letting the light and the heat burn off the sick damp sweat of
too much cleaning. It's a poor sort of pleasure, thin and weak and foul,
but even to feel it is to run the risk of the world deciding that it's
all I'm fit for. </font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">crocodiles</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He knocks on the
door and asks if my better half is in. I stare at him murderously,
rubber gloves heat-welded to my hands, and he quickly modifies his
statement ... your husband, is it? he asks. He has the brutal face of a
terrorist turned gangster, a hard Irish voice and eyes glassed over with
avarice. I'm speechless, and not sure whether to blame fear, anger, sleep
deprivation or four hours straight of cleaning. Neal takes over, and I
dab ineffectually at scraps of dust and listen with half an ear. He
wants to buy the house. That makes him the fourth or fifth so far. It's
a feeding frenzy. By the end of the conversation he's dropped back to
the desperate fall-back position of partner. Neal is far more reasonable
than I feel like being. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heft another
pair of black bags, take them down to the bins at the end of the street,
nervous, fast steps. I can feel them watching me from their balconies
and terraces, half-lidded eyes in crocodile faces, floating sleepily in
the afternoon heat. If they could be bothered to move I wouldn't stand a
chance. I feel young and tender, like the isolated buffalo calf that
signals carnage to come on a nature programme. If I hesitate, or show
any weakness, they'll be on me, burnt-brown bodies thrashing over each
other in the blue liquid air, a flash and gnash of expensive teeth,
their reptilian eyes gleaming glassily behind German glass or Swiss
corrective surgery.</font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the dog singer</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the heat of the
morning I sit out in the garden, curled into a white plastic chair. It's
hard to curl up in moulded plastic garden furniture, but I persevere. A
pot of coffee sits souring in the morning sun. I'm waiting for the night
to evaporate so that I can start cleaning again but I'm slow off the
mark this morning, slow as if my mind were whitening, like the dazzling
houses, like the sand on the beach, the floor in the bathroom. A dog
barks, and then another, and then another, and then they are all
barking.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are so many
dogs here. Dogs of every size, shape and persuasion. Dogs with bows,
dogs with hair, dogs so small they would comfortably fit under Damian's
foot. Dogs with teeth, barky dogs, dogs which probably seemed like a
good idea at the time, huge slavering beasts that drag their little old
ladies from corner to corner, until it's time to go on back to the house
they protect (along with the bars, burglar alarms, walls, security
lights). Usually I'm fond of dogs, but here I'm not so sure. They keep
appearing out of strange places: Their heads pop through balustrades and
out of shopping baskets, they peer out of bushes and up from under
steps. Every so often I feel eyes on me and look up and there's another
dog staring over a high wall with a lolling tongue and big, barky eyes.
They all have a hard, brittle look about them, as if the constant
sunshine has burnt away some of their essential doggieness. Their
domestic veneer is cracked and peeling. If this place goes to the dogs,
they'll all be fine. They can sleep in the sun and eat garbage. They can
do that for years.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The barking dies
away, one last spatter and it's gone. Now it's just me and the
sky, the twisted whistle of the starlings and the chir-chir-chir of the
crickets. In the quietness, a strange wailing groan arises from a nearby
house, some particularly repellent musical instrument, a
recorder, a melodica? The notes are disharmonious, a grating groan which
starts softly and then builds to an almighty crescendo, an irritated fuck-you to
the peace of the morning. The note sounds again, and this time a dog
joins it with a soft, keening howl. (In some white light-drenched room,
the melodica player pauses and smiles to hear the first little doggie.)
The notes build, squalling discordantly in the white morning. Another
dog howls, then another, then another... soon they're all at it,
and the unseen player's horrible note playing out over them all, cutting a
dog-shaped slice through the peaceful
community. I feel like cheering, but instead I start to join in as the
dog-chorus swells, alternating faint howls with shaking silent
laughter. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I want it go on, preferably for
days, but the note cuts out with stop-that suddenness, and the dog
chorus falters and dies, stray howls shrivelling in the whitening
day.</font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the fishing fleet in the sky</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it gets too
late, we walk down the hill to the sea. The light
is fading fast, and by the time we reach the pedestrian bridge the
coastal strip is a haze of dull pink sliced through with the red and
white streaks of cars. We stand and watch the pollutants build up for
long moments before heading down to the beach. The stream bed is almost
too dim to see, and I mince around the stagnant water with exaggerated
care. Neal's walking boots are good for much worse than this, and he
splashes happily through it all, stream, surf, slime. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The beach runs
less than a block in each direction before being stopped by breakwaters,
masses of tumbled stones the size of major appliances (ranging
from microwave to industrial driers). Whether they are there to
stop people moving between beaches or to stop the thin stretches of sand
from washing away, they are in our way, so we scramble across them,
reckless in the dying light. On the other side, an identical stretch of
sand and stones awaits us, backing onto an identical stretch of
apartments and villas, abandoned for the most part. It's the wrong time
of year, and the occasional lit window is nervous and self-effacing,
tidying itself back behind palm trees or awnings.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica,
sans-serif" size="2">Suddenly a broad black shadow rises out of the
dimness in front of us (Is that wood or stone? I ask. Stone, Neal
replies.) We climb up the broad cone of black rock and sit staring out
to sea. In the thick evening air no horizon bounds
the water, glittering with a faint reflection of the coastal lights. At eye
level, the sea begins to dissolve into the sky, above us the stars shine
weakly. A quick look for constellations reveals the big dipper
inconveniently behind us. A thin line of pale yellow
lights mark what might be a line of buoys, distant ships,
or the horizon. It is by far the easiest constellation to observe, and
we watch its stately progress across the far-off blackness with
incurious eyes. Neal tell me it's a fishing fleet. I wonder whether five
makes a fleet. Above, low stars twinkle fitfully. Below, the boats
continue their awkward progress. Neal comments on it when the boats
cross over into the sky; I make weak jokes about catching starfish, talk about
eating sea-urchins, realise I'm repeating myself, jolt into silence. A
star breaks away and starts heading back to shore. </font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">shells</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click and turn.
Swap cameras. Click again. Memories, mementos, souvenirs, proof. The
mirror in my room, a blank space in the bathroom. The picture on the
wall of the living room. Two yellow flowers I put in a cup three days
ago. Click. Click. Click.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I go down to the
beach in stages. Down the road on the edge of the <i>urbanization</i>, stucco
cliffs and lizards, dryland flowers in yellow and purple, the cream
walls and palm trees in one eye, roughlands awaiting development in the
other. Next a dog-leg out to look at the latest housing development,
rough areas of wasteland scattered with coke-cans and jemmied safes,
scaffold-cradled ranks of apartment boxes, looked over by proud banners
and cranes. Back to the wasteland, offerings of shattered marble tiles
and broken bottles gleaming in the sun around the wrecked shells of
utility vehicles. Grey concrete mixer striped with rust, tanker remnant
squatting on its black shadow. Twists of wire: barbed, razor, and plain.
The main road then, baking in the sun, shadows of palm trees and white
dust in the drains and solid German women carrying shopping bags full of
ten types of inedible bread back to their bloated recreational vehicles.
Off that as soon as possible, down a long curving drive to nowhere, not
much here: scattered bins, an abandoned tennis court behind a rusty
fence, complex drainage spotted with burnt scraps of foil. The drive
peters out into another new development, a broad scrape of torn-up soil
and proto-foundations and half-hearted barriers, a tiny digger perched
on a mound of earth keeping a proprietary eye on the site. I sneak past
it and onto a slip road, dodge the traffic outside the taxi rank and the
church and catch my breath in a tiny car-park between a tourist
office and the coastal road. Cypress fragments and road-dust and faded
glamour magazines at the base of the footbridge, and then it's over the
rumbling road and between the apartment block cliffs and down into the
sticky drain which leads to the sea. At the far end of the beach, a
brickish edifice crumbling into itself, an awkward conjunction of white
walls and the wrecked remnants of the last decade's tennis fences.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My finger clicks
on the end of the film and I walk back into the sun, slowly
rewinding. The tide is low,
and there are people walking on the beach; just a few. The water's edge
is a maze of weedy rocks and tiny rock pools and scored rock pavements.
Something bright catches my eye in a drift of small rocks and fragments
of shell. I pick it up; it's an abalone shell, barely bigger than my
thumb nail, as rainbow-perfect as oil spilt on water. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the next few
hours I think of nothing much. Feel the sun on the back of my head. Pick
up shells. </font></p> 

<h4><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">the orange square</font></h4>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monday morning, waiting to 
leave, oranges in the air and the soft play of fountains. We got up early
and struggled to a taxi, no real sleep for a week now, the world hazing in and out of
morning bright, there-and-gone landmarks against a backdrop of brown-grey-green
hills, as we play at spotting the inspiration for <i>Cocaine
Nights</i> out of the taxi's back-seat windows. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the the way to the
 <i>aerporto</i> we stop, and blunder into a quiet square, 
fountains filling pale blue
pools and channels, and clipped, dark-green trees, fragrant and peaceful. There are
roses, and decorative bricks and tiles, geometric shrubs and tiny,
symbolic, walls. Despite the formality and the signs and the obvious
richness of the square, the pools are littered with oranges. I ruminate
briefly on drunken orange fights, well-dressed men and elegant girls
pelting each other, well-fed sangria-drenched
laughter in the soft midnight air, and then I see the fruit, hanging
lamp-bright among the dark leaves. The tiny trees are orange trees, of
course.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sit on the pumping 
unit to rest, suitcase and
rucksack leaning drunkenly against a modestly decorative wall.
Thankfully, no-one calls the police. After a while, Neal heads off, and I wait
with the bags, eyes half-closed against the morning sun, smelling
oranges, but that's OK, it's not such a bad place to be waiting.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From here the
fountains and channels and pools stretch back in comforting symmetry, the
gentle arcs of water echoed by the sweeping curves of low walls and
planted beds, the sharp vertical of the prime fountain caught and echoed
back by slender orange trees, each terminating in a fountain of scented
green leaves and ripe fruit. I hum a Nyman tune, probably something from
<i>The Draughtsman's Contract</i>. In the pool immediately in front of
me, three floating oranges intrude on the symmetry,
bobbing in the plash of the fountain, a twig and a cigarette butt floating in to add
to their crime. </font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I watch the bright
orange globes bob in the turquoise pool, thin scrapes of twigs arc and
twist, accent points of floating detritus speckling the arrangement with
brown and black. Abstractedly watch Miro paintings appear and disappear
in the blue fountain. Sit and breathe in the sweet air in the square and
wait for Neal.</font></p> 

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We arrive at the
airport far too early. The cafe has huge fish and fresh orange juice. We
sit and drink coffee and, having exhausted our capacity for small-talk,
discuss the nature of consciousness, inbetween staring sullenly at the
fish and other people's planes.</font></p> 


<p align="centre">Eventually, an aircraft lands which will take us away. Halfway home, 
staring out of an ice-fogged window, I spot a grey wall in the sky, straight as
a ruler line, dark as a thundercloud and pull Neal's head towards the window until he 
can see it hurtling towards us in the half-moment before it's gone, as the plane 
bursts through the contrail, as the pilot announces rain in
London.</font></p>
